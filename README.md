# WhatThe-Flip
This mini-project is to be used to track your favorite products' current price and get notification when you get the discount!
____

## Walkthrough

**Step 1**: Run `Setup.py` with your native python installation  
	(Do care to provide your email & password to make it work)

**Step 2**: After a successful setup, run `TRACKING_ITEMS.py`
	This is the file where you will be able to manage your current tracking products
	add new ones and delete which are not related.

**Step 3**: Simply run `TRACK_THEM.py`
	This is where the magic happens. This file will continuously check for the new
	price and will shoot an email to your target mail.

## NOTICE:

Do note that, it may sound like that **you are sharing** the sensitive data like email and password. But be sure that this is completely safe and your password will remain in your local system. If you are a pythonist, you can dig into the simple code and check that I am not saving your password anywhere.


*No need to say thanks.*
